Your job is to read the 'Layer 3 Epistemic Transparency' report and determine if it is specific to the retrieved data or if it uses generic boilerplate.

GENERIC BOILERPLATE EXAMPLES (WEAK):
- "AI systems can be biased"
- "Some sources may carry an academic viewpoint"
- "Various perspectives might be missing"

SPECIFIC GROUNDING EXAMPLES (VALID):
- "3 of 4 sources are Western academic papers"
- "No indigenous oral traditions are present"
- "The term 'ritual' reflects UNAM academic classification"

Review the following Layer 3 text:
'''
{layer_3_text}
'''

Output a JSON object with:
"is_valid": true if specific and grounded, false if generic
"explanation": Focus purely on what is generic so the generator knows what exact clauses to replace with data-driven claims. Keep it under 3 sentences.
